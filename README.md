## Installation

### From Obsidian (easiest)

Install the plugin from the [Community plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=automatic%20table%20of%20contents) section in the app settings.

### From git

Clone the plugin in your `.obsidian/plugins` directory:

```shell
cd /path/to/your/vault/.obsidian/plugins
git clone git@github.com:johansatge/obsidian-automatic-table-of-contents.git
```

### From source

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/johansatge/obsidian-automatic-table-of-contents/releases) and unzip it in the `.obsidian/plugins/automatic-table-of-contents` directory.

## Usage and options

Insert a codeblock with the `table-of-contents` (or its short version `toc`) syntax.

````
```table-of-contents
option1: value1
option2: value2
```
````

Alternatively, two commands are available in the command palette:

- Insert table of contents
- Insert table of contents (with available options)

The following options are available:

| Option | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | _None_ | Title to display before the table of contents (supports Markdown) |
| `style` | `nestedList` | Table of contents style (can be `nestedList`, `nestedOrderedList` or `inlineFirstLevel`) |
| `minLevel` | `0` | Include headings from the specified level  (`0` for no limit) |
| `maxLevel` | `0` | Include headings up to the specified level (`0` for no limit) |
| `includeLinks` | `true` | Make headings clickable |
| `debugInConsole` | `false` | Print debug info in Obsidian console |

## Limitations and known bugs

- The table of contents may not be generated correctly if the document doesn't implement a correct titles hierarchy (level 1 title then level 3 without a level 2 in between, for instance)
- HTML & markdown that may be in the document headings are stripped when `includeLinks: true` (see [#24](https://github.com/johansatge/obsidian-automatic-table-of-contents/issues/24) & [#27](https://github.com/johansatge/obsidian-automatic-table-of-contents/issues/27))
- LaTeX equations are not rendered correctly when `includeLinks: true` (see [#13](https://github.com/johansatge/obsidian-automatic-table-of-contents/issues/13))
- Links might not behave correctly if the same title is present several times on the page (see [#57](https://github.com/johansatge/obsidian-automatic-table-of-contents/issues/57))
- Generated table of contents is not foldable (see [#23](https://github.com/johansatge/obsidian-automatic-table-of-contents/issues/23))
- The table of contents is based on a codeblock so it can updated; it doesn't generate real Markdown in the document, so it won't be visible when exporting, or on Obsidian Publish (see [#10](https://github.com/johansatge/obsidian-automatic-table-of-contents/issues/10#issuecomment-2676779810) and [#31](https://github.com/johansatge/obsidian-automatic-table-of-contents/issues/31))
